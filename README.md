# Secure-EVCS-demand-forecasting-under-adversarial-and-false-data-injection-attacks
This repository contains code and data for forecasting EV charging demand, testing model performance under cyber-attacks (FGSM, BIM, scaling FDI), and applying adversarial training to improve resilience and accuracy. **The code will be published after the paper is accepted for publication.**
